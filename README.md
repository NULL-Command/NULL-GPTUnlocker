## Features
- **Intermittent ChatGPT Plus Unlock**: Users manually unlock the feature by providing the email address of the ChatGPT account and pressing the Unlock button. Once unlocked, Plus features will be available for 10 to 15 minutes.
- **Continuous ChatGPT Plus Unlock**: Unlocking is performed automatically by the extension's service worker, occurring every 3.5 seconds. Users need to provide the email address of the ChatGPT account, enable Continuous Unlocking, and press the Unlock button. This ensures that Plus features remain continuously available on the unlocked account, but may put pressure on the system and could be blocked due to spam-like activity, which may limit usage.
